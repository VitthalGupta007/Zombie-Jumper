My First Unity Project - Zombie Jumper

Welcome to my first Unity project: Zombie Jumper! This project has been a labor of love, designed to introduce me to the world of game development. I'm proud to present it here on GitHub, and I hope you enjoy playing it, modifying it, or just learning from it as much as I enjoyed creating it.

About the Game
Zombie Jumper is a simple yet exciting game. The player must choose a character to play as, after which they are thrust into a world where enemies spawn from either side of the screen. The goal? To survive as long as possible by jumping over these enemies.

If you touch any of the enemies, your player character dies, and it's game over. This means the player must have good timing and reflexes to jump at the right moments and survive. It's a test of patience, skill, and reaction speed. How long can you survive?

How to Play
Start the game.
Choose your player character.
Once the game begins, enemies will start spawning from either side of the screen.
Use the jump control (space key on keyboard) to jump over the enemies.
Try to survive as long as you can!
